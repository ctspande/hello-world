pyautogui allows python to control the mouse and keyboard

#here is a simple click and drag drawing in Paint

import pyautogui 

pyautogui.click()
distance = 200 #amount of pixels to move
while distance > 0:
    print(distance, 0)
    pyautogui.dragRel(distance, 0, duration = 1) #drag mouse right, relative to its starting position
    distance = distance - 25
    print(0, distance)
    pyautogui.dragRel(0, distance, duration = 1) #drag mouse down, relative to its position from above
    print(-distance, 0)
    pyautogui.dragRel(-distance, 0, duration = 1) #drag mouse left, relative to its position from above
    distance = distance - 25
    print(0, -distance)
    pyautogui.dragRel(0, -distance, duration = 1) #drag mouse up, relative to its position from above
